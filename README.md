# Purpose and Scope
This document provides an overview of the elkDeployment repository, an automated ELK stack deployment system that combines infrastructure provisioning, log management, and data archiving capabilities. The system uses Ansible for server preparation and Docker Compose for orchestrating a complete ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) pipeline with automated data archiving to MinIO storage.

For detailed infrastructure setup procedures, see Infrastructure Provisioning. For comprehensive ELK stack configuration details, see ELK Stack Deployment. For information about testing with sample data, see Sample Data and Testing.
